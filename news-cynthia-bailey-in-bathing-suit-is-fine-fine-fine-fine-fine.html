She says that she is working on eating for herself. She explained that her eating became better when she was alone and quarantined. "When I returned back to Lake Bailey by myself, I was able to kind of manage my food a little bit better," Bailey says. "Because I didn't have my family with me and honestly some days I didn't even eat as much as before. It just wasn't an issue when I came home, because I was just eating for myself, so I was able to control what was in the refrigerator. I was able to control my snacking and all of that kind of stuff." Bailey said that this experience led her to make healthier eating choices.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/GettyImages-1474115086.jpg><p><span>Bailey tells TVTalk that she has started intermittent fasting as a way to eat better. "I started out just not eating anything until after 4 (p.m.), which was easy enough. I'm pretty busy during the pandemic now with work stuff, so that was pretty easy for me. Then, I would just eat maybe two healthy meals later that evening and that was it — and I just started slimming down. It was pretty awesome! I didn't realize how good I actually looked until I put on a two-piece. I was like, 'Wait a minute! I actually look OK!'"</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/shutterstock_1759126571.jpg><p><span>Bailey shared some of her favorite meals in her TVTalk interview. "I'll try to do salads," she says. "But not like a boring salad. Like a loaded salad; a loaded baked potato kind of salad with everything in it." Salad has a lot of benefits.</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> Colorado State University</span></a><span> states, "</span><span>Leafy green vegetables are nutrient rich because leaves contain the light-catching, energy-converting machinery of plants. Salad greens contain Vitamin A, Vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, folate, fiber, and phytonutrients (see Table 1). Leafy vegetables are a good choice for a healthful diet because they do not contain cholesterol and are naturally low in calories and sodium. Many of the health benefits that leafy greens provide come from phytonutrients, unique compounds that provide protection for plants. These compounds are becoming recognized as part of a nutritious diet that promotes long-term health. Phytonutrients can act as antioxidants, which help to prevent chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease."</span></p><p><span>Bailey has been working on her fitness, and documented her journey on Instagram. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this post</span></a><span>, she revealed that she has been working out on a regular basis for three months. "PROGRESS REPORT… I've been working out consistently [three] days a week for the past [three] months, and I can definitely say that not only have I lost some weight, but I am so much stronger and have so much more endurance! I also have more energy and feel great! Thank you to everyone who has encouraged me to keep going and to continue to stay healthy [and] great!"&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Bailey shares a lot of workout videos on Instagram. One thing she likes to do to stay in shape is weight train. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this video she posted</span></a><span>, Bailey is seen using weights at the gym. In it, Bailey does straight-arm lifts with hand weights and lifts a circle weight. She captioned the post, "</span><span>'It always seems impossible until it's done.'- Nelson Mandela."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxknLGeqbWqrYybmKKkla56qrqMm5itoJmjtG6%2F1KKrZqGjYrOqusRmnaKmlWKzqrrEZp2ippVis6q6xGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
