The Ravens explored the possibility of a deal, but shockingly found no takers that were willing to give up the draft pick compensation and contract necessary to land Jackson.</p><p>In the end, the Ravens inked their franchise quarterback to a five-year, $260 million deal that included $135 million in fully guaranteed money. Jackson rewarded Baltimore's faith with his second MVP season, throwing for 3,678 yards and 24 touchdowns against seven interceptions while adding 821 yards and five scores as a runner.</p><p>The Ravens again fell short of reaching their goal in the playoffs, losing 17-10 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game, but they'll head into the 2024 campaign again expected to compete for a Super Bowl.</p><p>"I'm not frustrated at all," Jackson <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a> after the loss to Kansas City. "I'm angry about losing. We are a game away from the Super Bowl. We've been waiting all this time, all these moments for opportunity like this and we fell short. But I feel like our team, we going to build this offseason, going to get right, get better grind and try to be in this position again—but on the other side of victory."</p><p>Baltimore has won at least 10 games in four of Jackson's five years as the team's primary starter. The Ravens are 58-19 overall with Jackson as their starter. They'll enter next season with another superstar on the roster at running back after signing Derrick Henry to a two-year contract earlier this month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWmAcX%2BMq5ivnZ6oeqmt0ZuYrp%2BYYrewt8innqWxXamyucDSZqOapZGnequtwqSqqKZdpLturc2noK%2Bdoqius8WMqJ1mrKKWsaZ50Z6orp2jqXqzsdWemKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
