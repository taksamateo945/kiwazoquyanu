Aniston passed away last November, however, it has taken this long to get to his exit partly because the show tapes so far ahead. However, instead of writing Victor as dying in his sleep, it seems the Days icon will die in a tragic plane crash instead.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Spoilers – Will Victor Kiriakis Perish In A Plane Crash?</h3><p>Days Of Our Lives spoilers reveal that DailyMail.com is reporting that Victor will perish in a plane crash and Days insiders seem to be supporting that. Of course, this would make perfect sense since Victor has been waiting for Bo Brady (Peter Reckell) to wake up from his coma. Bo has been placed in a long-term care facility and Victor has been very anxious to reunite with his son.</p><p><a href=#>Since Victor has named Maggie Kiriakis</a> (Suzanne Rogers) the CEO of Titan Industries, it would be normal for Victor to be coming or going to visit Bo for updates. Victor certainly doesn’t have the usual responsibilities to tie him down. Unfortunately, this will weigh on Bo when he does come to if his father dies traveling to check on him.</p><h3>Days Of Our Lives Updates – Victor Kiriakis Deserves A Fitting Exit</h3><p>If anyone deserves to go “out with a bang” it would be Victor. Over the years Victor has gone from a diehard businessman to the cranky Uncle/Grandfather that everyone knows him to be. Of course, Victor would still be traveling for some reason whether it was Titan business or looking for a specialist for Bo. Victor has never been on to take to his bed and stay there.</p><p>Victor is still the Kiriakis family’s go-to guy so everyone knows he isn’t lying around doing nothing. Victor has never been one to let grass grow under his feet or to accept defeat. Of course, if Victor is working on something for Bo, it would certainly add to Shawn Brady’s (Brandon Beemer) guilt since he shot Bo and put him in the coma in the first place.</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston)" width=800 height=475 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/08/days-of-our-lives-dool-spoilers-victor-kiriakis-dies-in-tragic-plane-crash/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days Of Our Lives (DOOL) Spoilers: Victor Kiriakis Dies In Tragic Plane Crash" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DOOL-Victor-Kiriakis-2.png></p><h3>Victor Kiriakis’ Funeral Should Be Soon</h3><p><a href=#>With the news of a crash circling as much as it is,</a> it seems Maggie will get the news of a crash. Victor’s family and friends will soon gather to say their goodbyes to the Kiriakis patriarch. After reading Victor’s letter to Caroline Brady (ex-Peggy McKay), Kayla Johnson (Mary Beth Evans) may reflect on this as Victor reuniting with her mother.</p><p>Will Victor’s exit lead to Phillip Kiriakis’ (John-Paul Lavoisier) return to Salem? Could Victor be on his way to bring Phillip home when his plan goes down? Whatever the case may be, it seems a crash is the most likely exit for Victor. It will be rough on Maggie to lose another husband, however, Maggie and Victor have spent many loving years together. Victor’s exit will certainly affect most of Salem in one way or another.</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with DOOL right now.<a href=#> Come back here often for Days Of Our Lives spoilers, news, and updates.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX90e49xZp2Zqah6sLKMqKyrZZyew6a%2FjJ2mqKRdqL2wtcueqaxlpp6wtbvRZqKiqpmWuKq%2FjJ2gnqtdnrtuwNGanqKbXaW5orrEZpqrmaOdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
