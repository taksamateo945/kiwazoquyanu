24. He doesn’t wear socks Like, ever. Though we have spotted him wearing his beloved “speckle socks” on several occassions, so we consider this story debunked.
23. He tried to buy a football club Last year, the Yorkshire lad tried to buy his hometown footie club, the Doncaster Rovers."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Some of these are nothing more than rumours, some are still awaiting verdict, and some we know to be true. Let’s go.</p><h3>24. He doesn’t wear socks</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-01.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 1" width=245 height=324 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Like, ever. Though we have spotted him wearing his beloved “speckle socks” on several occassions, so we consider this story debunked.</p><h3>23. He tried to buy a football club</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-02.jpg alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 2" width=339 height=257 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Last year, the Yorkshire lad tried to buy his hometown footie club, the Doncaster Rovers. We’re still horribly sad this deal fell through at the last minute as we’re always happy to see businessman Louis pouring his heart and soul (and money) into the things he’s passionate about.</p><h3>22. He sure is looking forward to having no responsibilities during One Direction’s hiatus</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-02.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 2" width=385 height=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This story is one that stems from Mr. Tomlinson himself, and seems to be his default answer when asked what he’s looking forward to during One Direction’s hiatus. Seems like a pretty weird thing to say when you supposedly have a baby on the way if you ask us, but yeah okay.</p><h3>21. He once played Danny Zuko in Grease</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-03.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 3" width=245 height=180 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>So do we Louis, so do we.</p><h3>20. He&nbsp;got kicked out of a hotel for bad behaviour</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-04.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 4" width=500 height=275 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>He wasn’t, but this story spread like wildfire anyway so we felt the need to include it.</p><h3>19. He’s too sassy for his own good</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-05.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 5" width=486 height=301 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Okay this one might be true.</p><h3>18. He insured his bum for £160000</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-06.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 6" width=492 height=389 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>I mean, if we had a bum like that, we’d probably make sure it’s insured too.</p><h3>17. He’s the most emotional one in the band</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-07.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 7" width=500 height=262 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Something his bandmates liked to point out when they were asked who would be the first to cry during a movie.</p><h3>16. He likes girls who eat&nbsp;carrots</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-03-1.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 3" width=468 height=264 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Spoiler: he doesn’t. Put that carrot suit away.</p><h3>15. He loves his&nbsp;cereal</h3><p><a href=#>https://twitter.com/Louis_Tomlinson/status/108861320710987776%20</a></p><p>We do too Louis, we understand!</p><h3>14. He’s been rude to fans</h3><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@paudieaudi</a> I was talking to the paps ( awkward ) but I'm sorry you misunderstood and felt the need to tweet! Have a good evening !</p><p>— Louis Tomlinson (@Louis_Tomlinson) <a href=#>October 1, 2015</a></p><p>Yeah sure, like he could&nbsp;ever&nbsp;be rude to his fans. This one was debunked by Louis himself pretty quickly.</p><h3>13. He once cooked a super romantic meal</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-08.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 8" width=245 height=211 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Yes, you heard it right. The most romantic thing our cereal-lover has ever done was cooking&nbsp;someone a meal consisting of chicken stuffed with mozzarella cheese, wrapped in parmaham, with a side of homemade mash. The band even has a little routine when telling this story.&nbsp;That’s&nbsp;how often they’ve told it.</p><h3>12. He kissed Liam on stage</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-03.jpg alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 3" width=491 height=334 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>We’re just gonna leave this picture here without comment.</p><h3>11. He also fought Liam on stage</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-04.jpg alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 4" width=498 height=448 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As they say: there’s a thin line between love and hate. Or something like that.</p><h3>10. And he’s been in a fight with Harry for years</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-09.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 9" width=500 height=217 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>And according to the source of this story, their “massive fallout” happened&nbsp;before this interview took place. Such great actors, these guys.</p><h3>9. He got engaged to his girlfriend Eleanor Calder</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-10.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 10" width=388 height=280 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Or maybe he didn’t.</p><h3>8. A woman once brought milk to his house after he tweeted</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-11.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 11" width=497 height=257 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>it really is, isn’t it?</p><h3>7. He spent £6000 to cheat at Fifa</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-12.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 12" width=500 height=250 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>That kinda does sound like him, if you ask us.</p><h3>6. He smokes weed from time to time</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-13.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 13" width=306 height=356 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Maybe he does, maybe he doesn’t, but he sure as hell looked really cute denying it at the Jonathan Ross show.</p><h3>5. He’s going to be an X Factor judge</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-14.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 14" width=500 height=417 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This story has been&nbsp;everywhere&nbsp;over the last few months. The only thing we’ll say about it is that Louis being a judge would sure boost the ratings.</p><h3>4. He has a tattoo on his bum</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-15.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 15" width=500 height=321 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>This gif kinda says it all.</p><h3>3. He’s expecting a baby with Briana Jungwirth</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-16.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 16" width=500 height=280 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Pointing out all the holes in this story would take us a lot longer than we have time for, but for now, let’s humour the people who helped this story into the world and categorize it as&nbsp;still awaiting verdict.</p><h3>2. And wants Simon Cowell to be the godfather of said baby</h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-17.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 17" width=500 height=220 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Totally.</p><h3>1. He’s in a relationship with Harry Styles</h3><h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/185.116.215.140/~celebmix/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/24-of-the-best-stories-surrounding-louis-tomlinson-18.gif alt="24 of the best stories surrounding Louis Tomlinson 18" width=500 height=246 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h3><p>As a very wise man called Elton John once said: “If a rumour doesn’t go away, it’s not a rumour”.</p><p>But let’s be fair and consider this story&nbsp;awaiting verdict as well.</p><p>What do you think?
