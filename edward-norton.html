His performance in Brian Friel’s Lovers brought him to the attention of playwright Edward Albee, whose one-act plays Norton enjoyed. In 1994, Norton auditioned for Albee’s Finding the Sun but did not get the part. Albee found a new role for him instead and had Norton read for Fragments. The playwright was impressed with Norton’s rehearsal performance and cast him for its world premiere. Albee remarked that Norton was a rare actor “who really knocked me out”. Norton recalled that he was inspired by Al Pacino, who also began his career in theater while struggling to establish himself in New York.</p><p>In 1995, casting agent Shirley Rich discovered Norton. He then rented a studio space near The Public Theater and presented his auditions of Shakespearean works to her. Impressed by his acting, she introduced Norton to the executives of the noir drama Primal Fear, an adaptation of William Diehl’s 1993 novel. He was selected for the part over two thousand other prospects. Released in 1996, Primal Fear features Norton in the role of Aaron Stampler, an altar boy who is charged with the murder of a Roman Catholic archbishop and is defended by Martin Vail (Richard Gere).

He feels it necessary to keep his off-screen life to himself and opts for a “normal life”. As soon as his career took off in the late 1990s, Norton asserted that, “If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I’m gonna have a heart attack”. AllMovie remarked that Norton attained “almost instant stardom” following his 1996 film debut in Primal Fear and could have risen to even greater fame. The Daily Telegraph attributed Norton’s lack of interest in celebrity status to his family of “distinguished political and social activists”.
