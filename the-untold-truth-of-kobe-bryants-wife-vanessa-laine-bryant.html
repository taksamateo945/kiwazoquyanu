Since then, she has been his biggest fan and has been with him through the best and toughest times.</p><h2><span id=Vanessa_Laine_Bryant_Age_Childhood_Facts>Vanessa Laine Bryant Age, Childhood, Facts</span></h2><p>Born Vanessa Cornejo Urbieta on the 5th May 1982, in Huntington Beach, California, USA; she is of Mexican ancestry. Vanessa had a troublesome childhood of divorced parents.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BvCDUepACjH/</p><p>She was just two years old when this happened, and went with her mother, who remarried to Stephen Laine, with whom she welcomed a second daughter, Sophie. Although Vanessa was never adopted by Stephen, she started using his last name. Vanessa attended Marina High School, but meantime worked as a backup dancer. She was just 17 years old when she met Bryant, and they married two years later.</p><p>Kobe was making his way into his basketball career at that time, and saw Vanessa in the video “G’d Up”, which was performed by The Eastsidaz. At first, there were problems in their romance as Kobe’s parents were against it, but they married on 18th April 2001 at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point, California. Again, their parents made a big fuss, but came to their senses when Kobe and Vanessa welcomed their daughter, Bianka Bella Bryant.</p><h2><span id=Trouble_in_Paradise>Trouble in Paradise</span></h2><p>Vanessa and Kobe were victims of media scrutiny when Kobe was accused of raping a hotel worker in 2003.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8-71Hc9PxM</p><p>He admitted that he had sexual intercourse with the particular girl, but has denied raping her. Vanessa remained with him throughout these years, and apparently it didn’t have any significant influence on their marriage. However, Vanessa filed for divorce in 2011, and the process lasted until 11th January 2013 when they both announced through social media that they had reconciled. Vanessa and Kobe now have four children, all daughters.</p><h2><span id=Kobe_Bryant_Bio>Kobe Bryant Bio</span></h2><p>Born Kobe Bean Bryant on the 23rd August 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, he is the youngest child of Joe Bryant, a retired basketball player, and his wife Pamela Cox Bryant. He has two older sisters. Kobe attended Lower Marion High School, and started playing basketball for the school team.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/130102002432-kobe-bryant-010113-driving.1280x720-1024x576.jpg></p><p>Over the years, he became the best player in the country at high school level, and with 2,883 points in total was Southeastern Pennsylvania’s all-time leading scorer.</p><h2><span id=NBA_Draft_Struggles_in_Early_Years>NBA Draft, Struggles in Early Years</span></h2><p>Kobe signed up for the 1996 National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft right out of high school, and was selected by the Charlotte Hornets as the 13th pick, but was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vlade Divac. In his first season <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kobe</a> didn’t play much, and his numbers were mediocre at best, finishing the rookie season with just 7.6 points per game.</p><p>Nevertheless, he got more playing time in the second season, and his numbers doubled.</p><h2><span id=Rise_to_Stardom_Jordan_Comparison>Rise to Stardom, Jordan Comparison</span></h2><p>From 1998 until 2010, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kobe</a> dominated the league and won five NBA Championship rings, which aroused a debate whether he is the best ever player in the league’s history. He has challenged Michael Jordan’s accomplishments, and the discussion continues until the present day. Some of Kobe’s other achievements include being named NBA Finals MVP in 2009 and 2010, appearing in 18 NBA All-Star Games, and has 11 All-NBA First team selections.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>8/24.

However, this wasn’t the end of his problems, as he suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in the left knee. He remained active as a player until the end of the 2015-2016 season, which was his 20th in the league, all with the Lakers. He finished his career with 33,643 points, 7,047 rebounds, and also had 6,306 assists.</p><h2><span id=National_Career_and_Net_Worth>National Career and Net Worth</span></h2><p>He was also successful on a national level, having won gold medals in 2007 at the FIBA Americas Championship, and at Olympic Games in 2008 in Beijing, and 2012 in London.</p><p>Kobe is a multimillionaire, and in addition to his playing career, he has also launched several other projects, including the Kobe Inc.
