The trophy-race festivities kicked off on Saturday, Jan. 4, at the 25th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival — a star-studded affair featuring appearances by <a href=#><strong>Tom Hanks</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amy Adams</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Bradley Cooper</strong></a>, among others.</p><p>With so many A-listers in attendance, there were plenty of memorable moments and buzz-worthy quotes. Among them? Golden Globe nominee Bullock's acceptance speech for her Desert Palm Achievement Award for Gravity.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you are told you are going to receive an honor like this from the Palm Springs International Film Festival, you spend the next couple of weeks crapping yourself [about] what you are going to say. And if you know me, I don't take compliments well, and I don't feel comfortable in these situations," the 49-year-old actress began. "I thought it would be a nice, fun approach to this evening to do something different, so I Googled myself and read the comments section, thinking I would get some tidbits on what people really think of me and share that with you for humor."</p><p>"No human should ever read the comments section or Google oneself at any time!" she joked. "But I did learn a lot about myself. Some things I was very well aware of. 'Sandra Bullock is over 40' came up a lot. I know that. 'Sandra Bullock is way past 40.' Yep, I know that, too!"</p><p>One thing the single star — and mom to son <strong>Louis</strong>, 4 — didn't know? She and August: Osage County actress Julia Roberts are fighting over a fellow A-lister. "Apparently, Julia — I don't know where you are — but apparently, you and I are in a dispute over <a href=#><strong>George Clooney</strong></a>," the Blind Side Oscar winner joked. "We talked about this, right? We share custody, and we are both fine with it!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bullock went on to note a few other comments, such as, "There is absolutely nothing special about her acting," "She is not particularly attractive," and "She is mediocre." Normally, she said, those insults would bring her down — but as she was reading, she was also watching movies, which reminded her why she's in showbiz and sparked memories of incredible moments in her career.</p><p>"I got to do things like play 'Chopsticks' on a floor piano with Tom Hanks," she recalled. "I was reminded that I made out with Meryl Streep. Off screen, not necessarily her choice…I worked with <strong>Betty White</strong>. I've flown into space. I've had a pretty good life, and a pretty good career."</p><p>Last year, in particular, was one for the books. "I have had a very fortunate year! Warner Bros. keeps hiring me. The next year could be a real stinker," the star, who made a bang in 2013 in both Gravity and The Heat, quipped. "So from this not particularly talented or mediocre over-40 woman, I am so grateful and so thankful, and I so appreciate this."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKqappSnrm6u1KWjqJubYr2iuMxmqqmqmaO0tHnFoqOmZZaawLW11ZqjZqKlobaiedGomZ6qpKh6p7HUnWSgnZ%2BntKZ5wqWmqKaVrnpzfJBtbWo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
