ESPN's DJ Bien-Aime reported Dell participated in the AFC South team's OTAs on Tuesday and had no limitations as he took part in individual drills, 7-on-7s and 11-on-11s.
As Bien-Aime noted, the wide receiver was shot during a private event on April 28 and suffered a minor injury that required him to get checked at a hospital."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He was limited to 11 games last season because he suffered a broken leg during a December contest against the Denver Broncos.</p><p>It cut short an excellent rookie season that saw him tally 47 catches for 709 yards and seven touchdowns.</p><p>Dell was part of a memorable season for the Texans, who went from 3-13-1 in 2022 to AFC South champions at 10-7 in 2023. Rookie quarterback C.J. Stroud was a major reason for the turnaround, but the combination of Nico Collins and Dell also helped spark the playoff run.</p><p>"Happy for Tank to get back out there. He went through a very tragic situation," Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said. "We're just happy that he's here, happy that he's back out being able to do what he loves doing and that's playing football. It's fun to see him running around. Being that same player he's been before, making plays and being a dynamic player for us. Everyone is excited to see Tank."</p>NFL <span class=acct>@NFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rookie ➡️ Rookie&lt;br>&lt;br>C.J.

The combination of Diggs, Collins and Dell should be a nightmare for opposing secondaries, as it's impossible to double-team all of them on a single play.</p><p>That should mean plenty of single coverage on Dell during his second season, which could mean an even better 2024 campaign for the wide receiver.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmaGdYOMrZino12Zsq24jKucra2io8BuwM5mq56wkaPAbrzRmpqtoZOaenR51p6cpKtdlrO1sdFmqq6elpq%2FqrrGZqCnoqWnxm61zWaqoaefqbavsw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
