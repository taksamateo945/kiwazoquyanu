After people moved into the dining room, it wasn’t really a sit-down affair, but there was food and tables for people to sit down where they wanted. People were dancing, moving to the music all night.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Heming, 36, shared photos from the event with the label “Bee Dub’s 60th” on Instagram, writing, “It’s fair to say the birthday boy had a great time. #BWBirthdayBash.”&nbsp;</p><p>They also shared a romantic dance, which was captured by a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>“At least someone was taking pics. Thank you @jmtaekman #BWBirthdayBash,” she captioned the sweet shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Willis’ other celebrity guests included <strong>Patti Hansen, Keith Richards</strong>, and <strong>Tony Bennett</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In addition to Heming’s company, Willis also had his daughter <strong>Tallulah</strong> by his side. His eldest daughter <strong><a href=#>Rumer</a></strong> is currently in Los Angeles, rehearsing for Dancing With the Stars. Last week the family, including Willis’ ex <strong><a href=#>Demi Moore</a></strong>, sat in the audience to support Rumer, 26, in the show’s premiere.&nbsp;</p><p>“They always made an effort to do all of the family events still together and made such an effort to still have our family be as one unit, as opposed to two separate things, which I think really made an impact,” Rumor recently told Larry King.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Willis’ 23-year-old daughter&nbsp;<strong>Scout</strong> also gave a special toast to the birthday boy.</p><p>“It was clear that these people cherish him,” Nortar tells Us. “The birthday cake came out and everyone sang happy birthday, his family, Tony, everyone.
