Sources revealed that Gunvalson has been stirring up a lot of drama as she fights for her spot on the show, but only an engagement was enough to keep her from losing her job.</p><p>“Bravo execs are waiting to see what she delivers,” the source revealed.</p><p>The insider added that if Gunvalson does not get engaged by the end of filming, she will lose her position on the show. Even more, producers want the engagement to happen on camera, which is only adding more stress to the situation. The rumors come amid speculation that Gunvalson was demoted prior to the start of filming.</p><p>Based on Cohen’s post, it does not sound like Gunvalson was forced to get engaged to keep her job. That does not eliminate the chance of seeing an engagement next season, but it looks like Gunvalson will be keeping her full-time status after all.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mother-of-two Briana Culberson left the show after season 12 ended. <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/TG7dIQHnfn</a></p><p>— OK!

Before dating Lodge, Gunvalson was married to Donn until their divorce in 2014. The OG of the OC and Donn got hitched in 1994 and do not share any children. Gunvalson’s first husband was Mike, with home she had two kids.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Vicki Gunvalson and the rest of her co-stars are currently in the middle of filming Season 14 of the Real Housewives of Orange County.
