She appeared on </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span>. She has her own podcast, </span><i><span>The Blonde Diaries</span></i><span>. And she's a YouTuber. Bedford celebrated her 24th birthday this week. She made sure to share some gorgeous photos on Instagram. In them, she enjoyed a day in the sun, and a night out. She captioned the post, "24." </span><span>How does she stay so fit? </span><span>Read on to see 5 ways Mary Bedford stays in shape and the photos that prove they work.</span></p><p><span>In an episode of her </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>podcast</span></a><span>, Bedford opened up about what it was like coming home after </span><i><span>Love Island</span></i><span> and having her grandmother die. She says that she struggled with the emotions, and turned to fellow contestant, Ellie Brown, for support. "Coming off, there was the added pressures of Love Island, then the pressure of everything at home, so I went into a really dark place. Like, December, January, I was really sad. Nobody knew this, this weren't in the press, this has never even been spoken about.&nbsp; My family knew, my friends knew, and that was it. So, coming off the show, at first I did regret it. I was like, 'What have I done?' Another thing was, if I hadn't gone on the show I would have gotten to say goodbye. So many things were going through my head, I was like, 'What have I done? I've ruined my own life. I weren't there to say goodbye to my grandma'. It was a really difficult thing to deal with, but then come February, I met Ellie and Ellie was like, 'I went through the same thing a few years ago' and you start realising it's normal.</span></p><p><span>In her podcast, Bedford revealed that she has new-found gratitude for her time on </span><i><span>Love Island. </span></i><span>"I wouldn't even go to the shop. Not saying I'm this massive famous person, but I was struggling. But I've gone on to have literally the best year of my life. We've had an absolute ball. Now I can really look back on the show and say 'thank you for doing that' and I don't regret it. It was the best thing that could have ever happened to me and my family."</span></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this video</span></a><span> on her YouTube channel, Bedford opened up about her diet and what she eats each day. She says that she makes sure to eat healthy, and has some secrets for doing so. One of them is tracking her food each day. "I do use MyFitness Pal to track all my food. Then it's just easy. I can work out."</span></p><p><span>Bedford spends a lot of time outside. One thing she likes to do is swim. She shares a bunch of posts on Instagram of herself by the water. Bedford shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this photo</span></a><span> of herself walking in the ocean. She captioned the post, "Beachy." She also shared </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>this photo</span></a><span> of herself in the pool, captioning it, "Takin a dip."</span></p><p><span>Bedford recently learned how to ski. She took a trip to the mountains in Meribel earlier this year, and shared highlights on Instagram. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>In this set of photos</span></a><span>, she is seen on the slopes with her friends. Bedford captioned the post, "All the gear & no idea." Skiing has a lot of benefits. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>The Canadian Ski Council States</span></a><span>, "It's well documented that skiing and snowboarding benefits cardiovascular health, overall fitness, strength, coordination, balance and more. Regardless of your health and fitness goals, strapping on a pair of skis or a snowboard is sure to fulfill some of them. Due to the versatility of skiing and snowboarding, it can encompass the benefits of a cardio workout, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session, and strength training session, all in one fun activity."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkppmirnqjscOfpqucXai1or7ErGSsr5miwLa102anoaekpHq1wdGnoKefXWeBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
