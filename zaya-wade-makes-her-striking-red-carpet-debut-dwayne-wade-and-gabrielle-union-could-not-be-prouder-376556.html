Last night was Zaya’s first red carpet and we couldn’t have been prouder of how she handled the questions that were asked of her. She has emerged as one of the young faces and voices for the LGBTQ+ community.’</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/B9ex9hApdVO/</a></p><p>Gabrielle also shared a video of the three of them accompanied by a caption that read: ‘We keep moving forward. We keep leading with love, light, and hope for a better more inclusive world. Stay put and stay mad if you want. We keep it pushing. Always.’</p><p>This comes after Dwyane visited The Ellen Show where he revealed exactly how Zaya came out as trans.</p><p>‘Zaya, our 12-year-old, came home — I don’t know if everyone knows, originally named Zion; Zion, born as a boy — came home and said, ‘Hey, so I want to talk to you guys. I think going forward, I’m ready to live my truth. And I want to be referenced as she and her. I’d love for you guys to call me Zaya.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It’s great to see Zaya living in her truth.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeqlsaiedaam55lnZa4pr%2BMoZyrZaOpv6q3yKeeZqqVmXqkrdGpnK1llJqvtsCMna6asZ6aeritw55kmqaUYrSirtGinKWklWLCr7XOp2Scp6WhsW66zq1km51dpb%2BwwcOeqWZrZ2uCdoKO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
