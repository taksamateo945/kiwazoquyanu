The Utah native also said that she now has exclusive custody of their three-year-old son Taeyang.&nbsp;Deavan met Jihoon, a South Korean native, on a dating app and they immediately clicked. He immediately made his way to America, and she became pregnant after their first date. The couple’s whole journey was filmed in the TLC 90 Day Fiancé spin-off, and fans saw them get married then split up after appearing on Season 2 of the program.</p><p>The couple divorced in real life, but they had to keep working on their marriage to get paid to appear on the program. Deavan disclosed in a recent Instagram live that they were only paid $1000 each episode and that most of the cast members were only on for a maximum of 6 episodes.</p><h2>Deavan Clegg and Jihoon Lee’s relationship timeline</h2><p>Fans of 90 Day Fiancé had already made up their minds about the couple’s destiny while they were still on the program. Jihoon lacked financial experience and struggled to maintain a regular career, while Deavan struggled to adapt into an altogether other society and learn the native Korean language. Their love didn’t survive long, and in the season finale, viewers saw Deavan depart the nation with Taeyang and her daughter Drascilla from a previous relationship. While Jihoon claimed it was merely a brief visit, he quickly added that his ex-wife accused him of injuring Drascilla. Meanwhile, Deavan’s Instagram photos indicated that she had returned to the United States and was not wearing her wedding band.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Deavan-Clegg-1.jpg alt="deavan clegg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Jihoon reported that the Utah native has found someone new around August 2020. This was accurate, as she had met Christopher Hyun Park (Topher), a Los Angeles-based accountant and former actor. While she hoped to co-parent, the 90-Day Fiancé actress said that her ex-husband banned her phone number on social media.&nbsp;Deavan filed for divorce in September 2020. Meanwhile, Jihoon established a GoFundMe campaign to hire a Utah counsel. But he cut relations with his lawyer and abandoned practically everything.</p><p>Deavan went to Instagram on Monday after their divorce was completed to announce their formal separation, writing:</p><p>“I am formally divorced after a nearly two-year fight. I couldn’t be more pleased. This voyage was challenging and exhausting. My ex never showed up to court or took visits after he dismissed his counsel. We finally got it to court after almost a year of the judge postponing and extending dates for my ex to answer…”</p><p>She went on:</p><p>“After a year of anguish, I can finally put this chapter behind me. For those who are curious, I was granted exclusive and physical custody. I can now speak up about my story and the misery that our family went through. I want to release a video shortly.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Deavan-Clegg-2.jpg alt="deavan clegg" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Soon after, she turned to Instagram to address some of the most often asked questions regarding Taeyang, Jihoon, and his family. One of the key grounds for her obtaining custody was her ex-failure husband’s to contact her or pay child support for their kid.&nbsp;The Utah native also said that the 90 Day Fiancé production crew contacted her and asked if they could continue another season of a spin-off despite knowing about the troubles between the two, which she refused. Deavan also said that they kept shooting because they needed the money.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibnpmmlrtur8uenqBlkaOxbrbIoaaopl2hsqZ5x5qtnmWRo7uwwc2cnJ1lpJ2yqr6MnaCvp6KYsm67zWaqqJuZlrluucSdoJpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
