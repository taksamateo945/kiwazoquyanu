Many historical and mystical wizards form the characters depicted in fictional movies today. The likes of the Harry Porter series are known for their incredible wizardry, as seen in the Hufflepuff Wizards and and the Ravenclaw Wizards. Historical figures like Nostradamus, Prospero, and Aleister Crowley have well-deserved spots on this list and also the mythical wizards that are all-powerful."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The likes of the Harry Porter series are known for their incredible wizardry, as seen in the Hufflepuff Wizards and and the Ravenclaw Wizards. Historical figures like Nostradamus, Prospero, and Aleister Crowley have well-deserved spots on this list and also the mythical wizards that are all-powerful.</p><h2><strong>Famous Ravenclaw Wizards</strong></h2><p class=heading_excerpt>Ravenclaw is known as the Hogwarts House of geniuses and eccentrics in the Harry Potter franchise with its crop of powerful wizards.</p><li><h3><strong>Harry Potter</strong></h3></li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/ceae0970aaba42c1-e1696579392833.jpg><p>Harry Potter is a name that deserves a mention when you want to talk about Ravenclaw Wizards. Orphaned as a newborn, Harry grew up under the watch of his relatives, where he faced maltreatment.</p><p>When he turned 11, Harry discovered his magical powers, which led him to join the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to hone his natural skills, marking the beginning of his wizardry. This fictional wizard was the lead character in the famous Harry Potter franchise.</p><h3><strong>2. Filius Flitwick</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/b5ffc08cdd753cc8ac523b6c1ce3d58a-e1696578599673.jpg><p>Filius Flitwick makes our list of the most Famous Wizards. He was the one who headed Ravenclaw House while Harry Porter was attending Hogwarts as the professor of Charms class, and he is listed among the most powerful Ravenclaws. During his younger days, he functioned as a dueler and is known to be half Goblin, which gives him a longer lifespan and stronger magic.</p><p>A better part of his life was spent teaching the younger generation spell-casting tricks using their magic wands.</p><h3><strong>3. Garrick Ollivander</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-e1696578788973.jpg><p>Another famous Ravenclaw wizard is Garrick Ollivander, who was already practicing magic long before the famed Harry Potter got his first wand from Diagon Alley. Garrick was the man who ran the Ollivander family wand shop.</p><p>He was skilled in creating perfect wands, and in addition, he also had the knack for the exact wand that was suitable for each wizard. He made a mark among wizards of the UK, making their craft easier. Garrick Ollivander has a photographic memory, as the Ravenclaw remembers every single wand he sold and the wizard that bought it.</p><h3><strong>4. Quirinus Quirrell</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-1-e1696578953126.jpg><p>Our Famous Wizards list must include Quirinus Quirrell. Professor Quirrell, as he is called, is listed among the most influential Ravenclaws. Powerful and intelligent, Quirinus had Voldemort living comfortably on the back side of his head for one year.</p><p>Dubbed the master of deception, the Ravenclaw cut the image of a coward before his students as they believed he warded off vampires with garlic in his turban. However, the truth is that Quirinus is one of Voldemort’s followers; in reality, he is highly calculating and cold. With his intelligence, the professor found the dark wizard and was planning to bring him to life when he was bested by Harry, but not without a good fight.</p><h3><strong>5. Gilderoy Lockhart</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-2-e1696579119395.jpg><p>Ravenclaw graduated a lot of wizards, but Gilderoy Lockhart is listed among its most famous graduates. His proficiency with memory and natural ability to weave very tall tales distinguished him. The books he wrote about his exploits were busted when it became glaring that he didn’t undertake those exploits.</p><p>Lockhart’s ability to obliterate people’s memories was stopped by Ron Weasley and Harry Potter when they made him wipe his own memory instead.</p><h2><strong>Famous Hufflepuff Wizards</strong></h2><p>Hufflepuff is part of the Hogwarts houses in Harry Potter and it embodies some of the most famous wizards that have contributed to shaping the magical world significantly.</p><h3><strong>6. Cedric Diggory</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-e1696588168771.jpg><p>Cedric Diggory deserves a mention among the most famous wizards list. A Hufflepuff, Cedric was among the first to be known.</p><p>It was at the Triwizard Tournament that his true power as a champion shined through, but before then, he was Seeker of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team, including a Prefect. His clever transformation made it possible for him to trick a dragon during his first task and get access to the golden egg. His second task was also successful, and he had help from Harry Porter in his third task to reach the Triwizard Cup. However, Voldemort ordered Peter Pettigrew to kill him, which marked the end of his life.</p><h3><strong>7. Theseus Scamander</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-1-e1696588333100.jpg><p>Theseus Scamander was a Hufflepuff hero. During the World War, he rendered help to Muggles, and ten years on, his name still rang a bell as a hero. The British Ministry of Magic made him the Head of the Auror Office – a feat only meant for the most accomplished Aurors.</p><p>His powers made it possible to become the leader of the Gellert Grindelwald hunt, battling evil wizards and helping save Paris from the consuming blue fire that he helped put out. He is likely to get even more powerful with the continuation of the Fantastic Beasts movie series.</p><h3><strong>8. Newt Scamander</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-3-e1696588528922.jpg><p>Out of all the famous wizards, none understands magical creatures as much as Newt Scamander. This was precisely where his incredible power lies, and he leveraged it to educate others on the best way to co-exist peacefully with magical creatures and control and assist them simultaneously.</p><h3><strong>9. Fat Friar</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-e1696588716517.png><p>Fat Friar has been described as a true Hufflepuff. During his lifetime, he was leveraging his magic to heal peasants who had pox by poking them with a stick. His kindness extends to death – when he became a ghost, Friar had the heart to forgive Peeves despite his troublesomeness. He even went against his fellow Hogwarts ghosts to give Peeves a second chance.</p><h3><strong>10. Silvanus Kettleburn</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-1-1-e1696588866119.jpg><p>Silvanus Kettleburn was a Professor of Care for Magical Creatures and Rubeus Hagrid’s predecessor. He was known for his unreasonable recklessness that was only comparable to that of Kettleburn, who was quite a character. The consequences of Kettleburn’s recklessness made him lose most of his limbs.</p><h2><strong>Famous Wizards In History</strong></h2><p>A plethora of famous wizards are listed in history, including the likes of Nostradamus, Prospero, Aleister Crowley, and more.</p><h3><strong>11. Nostradamus</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Nostradamus-Prediction-2018-e1696592423282.jpg><p>The French astrologer, Nostradamus existed during the 16th century and was patronized by several noblemen, including the wife of King Henry II of France, Catherine de’ Medici. Nostradamus’ reputation as a seer was cemented when his predictions about his three sons becoming kings came to pass, they eventually reigned as Kings Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III.</p><p>His book titled Les Propheties, contained other predictions, including the rise and fall of Napoleon, the rise of Adolf Hitler, WWI, WWII, and even the September 11 attacks, all of which came to pass.</p><h3><strong>12. Prospero</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-2-e1696592516861.jpg><p>In William Shakespeare’s drama, The Tempest, Prospero is the protagonist. A historical figure, Prospero was the Duke of Milan until his brother betrayed and set him and his daughter adrift.</p><p>When father and daughter eventually settled on an island, Prospero leveraged his magical powers to control the weather and fend off threats. His powers also released Ariel and binds Caliban.</p><h3><strong>13. Aleister Crowley</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-4-e1696592723497.jpg><p>The list of famous wizards in history cannot be complete without mentioning Aleister Crowley. An English occultist, Aleister functioned as a philosopher, poet, ceremonial magician, painter, mountaineer, and novelist.</p><p>After he claimed to be a prophet, Aleister founded the religion of Thelema and without prior preparations, he leveraged imitative magic to spiritually knock his congregation to the ground. He reigned from 1875-1947 and was made a cult figure after his death.</p><h3><strong>14. Gandalf</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-1-1-e1696592981483.jpg><p>Only a few famous wizards could rival Gandalf in power, wisdom, and sheer tenacity. The growing threat of Sauron in the Middle-earth was a menace during his time and Gandalf was part of the mighty Istari that went to combat it.</p><p>He took charge of the Fellowship of the Ring, guiding them with remarkable cunning and resilience.</p><h3><strong>15. Saruman</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-2-1-e1696593167954.jpg><p>Also known as Saruman the White, Saruman worked like Gandalf. Valar sent him to the Middle-earth to lead other wizards during the Third Age. As a wizard leader, Saruman had more access to power compared to his contemporaries. He was equally as cunning as Gandalf, and had a great understanding of Sauron.</p><h2><strong>Famous Wizards In Mythology</strong></h2><p>Many famous wizards exist in mythology, including Merlin, Shazam, Jafar, and more</p><h3><strong>16. Shazam the Wizard</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/R-3-e1696595752121.jpg><p>The famous wizard Shazam was an ancient Egyptian sorcerer. He fought against evil for ages in his Golden Age incarnation and when old age came calling, he got a teen called Billy to carry on some of those incredible powers. The teenager only needed to mention Shazam’s name. Though he passed on a long time ago, the ghost of Shazam still works through Billy.</p><h3><strong>17. Merlin</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/dff57779ce18c9f0e43a30c0c29a903d-e1696596259367.jpg><p>We saw the mythological character of Merlin in the Arthurian legend as King Arthur’s right-hand man. His work was to leverage his extraordinary powers in assisting Arthur’s kingdom. However, Merlin’s weakness was women and that was what led to his end. The character of Merlin has been depicted in pop culture by many movie makers and has been played by many, including Jacques Chambon, Yasuo Hisamatsu, Joseph Fiennes, Gary Oldman, and Ben Kingsley among others.</p><h3><strong>18. Jafar</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/jafar-famous-wizards--e1696595844975.jpg><p>The notoriously scheming Jafar was a royal vizier of Agrabah and during his reign, he was a master of deception. When it comes to sorcery, Jafar was second to none.</p><p>However, the lust for power drove him to attain magical powers encompassing mind control, shape-shifting, and that dreadful ability to reach out beyond the grave and summon dark powers.</p><h3><strong>19. Rumplestiltskin</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/download-e1696596330942.jpg><p>Rumplestiltskin is an enigmatic figure that we cannot fail to mention on this list of most famous wizards.</p><p>This mythological character is quite captivating with his supernatural ability to easily spin straw into gold. Rumplestiltskin was over-ambitious, cunning, and a mischief-maker. Leveraging his magical powers, he struck bargains with unwitting individuals. His complexities are testaments to the entrancing allure of tales woven with magic.</p><h3><strong>20. Sparrowhawk</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/OIP-5-e1696596533966.jpg><p>From humble beginnings, Sparrowhawk went on to gain fame as a prominent wizard in Earthsea. The former reckless youth is known as a master of lore, magical language, and more. He had the supernatural capacity to bend reality to his will.</p><p>From arrogance, he journeyed to wisdom and his experience is a testament to an ageless tale of personal growth as well as the transformative power of modesty.</p><h2><strong>Famous Wizards In Movies</strong></h2><p>Through pop culture, we have watched many actors portray some of the most famous wizards in history. A few are listed below.</p><p><strong>21.
