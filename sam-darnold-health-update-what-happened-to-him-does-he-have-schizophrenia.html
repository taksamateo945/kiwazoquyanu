Does He Have Schizophrenia?</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-01-30</div><p>Following Darnold’s “seeing ghost” remark, some mocked him, while others began to wonder, “<strong>Does Sam Darnold have schizophrenia?” Is Sam suffering from a mental illness?</strong>&nbsp;On national television, Sam Darnold mistakenly informed the crowd that he was “seeing ghosts” on the field. Sam’s one statement blew up the internet. Sam Darnold, aka Samuel Richard Darnold, was born on June 5, 1997, in Dana Point, California.</p><p>He is a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) who is presently committed to the San Francisco 49ers.&nbsp;The New York Jets selected Richard third overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. Furthermore, at the age of 21, he became the NFL’s youngest opening-day starting quarterback since the AFL-NFL merger.&nbsp;He received the Archie Griffin Award as the first freshman at the University of Southern California. In addition, he was named Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2016 and First-Team All-Pac-12 in 2017.</p><h2>Is Sam Darnold Suffering From Schizophrenia?</h2><p>Most football fans are concerned about <strong>Samuel Darnold’s mental health</strong> and are continuously wondering whether he has schizophrenia.&nbsp;When Sam recounted seeing the ghost in the field, the subject of schizophrenia came up.&nbsp;Darnold had his worst game as a pro, with five giveaways. He hurried to the bench after his third error in the second quarter and shouted, “I’m seeing ghosts.” That video quickly went viral.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sam-Darnold-1.jpg alt="Sam Darnold" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, most people felt he manufactured the reason to get out of that scenario.&nbsp;Also, after the game, the crowd remarked he handled it well, telling the media that he always tries to be honest with his coaches.&nbsp;Furthermore, he informed the press that he needs to “see the field a lot better” to take on New England’s blitz-heavy defense.</p><p>“That’s what it is. Even worse has occurred to me. But, on the other hand, it’s a shame that it was live. It’s a far more popular term than it’s given credit for.” Sam said.</p><p>So, after this remark, there is no indication that he is schizophrenia. As a result, we cannot assume that he is suffering from mental illness only based on this statement.</p><h2>Sam Darnold Affected with Kissing Disease</h2><p>Sam Darnold was diagnosed with Mononucleosis. He had to take a three-week hiatus from the games during that period. Darnold made his debut against the Cowboys after recovering from his injury and delivered one of the best performances of his short career.&nbsp;Furthermore, the quarterback revealed in an ESPN interview that he originally mistook the prognosis for a joke when it was provided by head coach Adam Gase.</p><p>“When they told me I had mono, I burst out laughing.” I assumed they were kidding. And that was certainly not a joke.” Darnold brought it up.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sam-Darnold-2.jpg alt="Sam Darnold" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, since mononucleosis is sometimes known as “the kissing disease,” the athlete assumed it was not the kind of ailment that would readily infect adults.&nbsp;It wasn’t, however, a joke. Fortunately, Sam recovered quickly from the sickness and returned to the game.&nbsp;He also said that Darnold was just ill for three to four days, but the team and coach pushed him to rest for three weeks for his safety.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqmqVdma6zus6lm2aglZa5tbSMrqedmaSaeri0wK1koZmgpbKvscNmq6hlmJ66brDOnqpmoJVitaLCxGaqnKCZr7yxtNGepaKZXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
