And finally, on our way home from school one day, I stopped the car and asked my azawakh girl Soleil to hold the pose for a moment while I took the photo.</p><p>Already in the camera I saw that it had become something more than I had hoped for; a moment of clean stillness in the busy and messy everyday life, something more than a posing dog on a log stack.<br>The image made me linger in the moment.</p>Sanna Sander<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2nd-place-serene-snowfall-by-grace-fieselman>2nd Place – “Serene Snowfall” by Grace Fieselman</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portrait-Landscape-2.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3rd-place-monochromatic-illusion-by-sanna-sander>3rd Place – “Monochromatic Illusion” by Sanna Sander</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Portrait-Landscape-3.jpg><p>On a silent morning when the last snow of the winter was melting the fog rolled over the meadows and the trees stretched into the sky, begging the sun to return.</p><p>The colors were sucked out of the world, and everything was silent except the crowing ravens adding to the atmosphere.</p><p>In the stillness she posed, watching the winter slowly leaving and making way for spring.<br>In the stillness she was the only color left in the world.</p><p>She was the queen of this monochromatic illusion.</p>Sanna Sander<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-action-winners>Action Winners</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1st-place-stop-your-motion-by-jacqueline-rudiger>1st Place – “Stop Your Motion” by Jacqueline Rüdiger</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Action-1.jpg><p>Have you ever seen a dog, or even better a sighthound, running in pure joy? You see the power, the play of the muscles and the perfect anatomy for running fast. In this picture I wanted to show the speed of this dog and capture it, but at the same time freeze the motion to show the anatomy of this beautiful dog. To get it you need a perfect timing of all components involved. The dog, the lights and for sure me as the photographer. The result is a stunning composition reduced to the only important thing, the dog.</p>Jacqueline Rüdiger<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2nd-place-moment-of-entry-by-roberta-holden>2nd Place – “Moment of Entry” by Roberta Holden</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Action-2.jpg><p>I have become fascinated by the dynamic interplay between air, water and light in turbulence as water is suddenly displaced at the moment of impact as a dock-diving dog enters the water.
