He has a tall, long, thick-limbed build with solid athletic ability and good play strength.</p><p>Adams had to play right tackle for the majority of the 2023 season, struggling early (Ex: vs. Penn State) before becoming more functional as the year went on. But he was clearly more comfortable inside.</p><p>Adams is an above-average run-blocker with solid quickness, burst and body control to get to his landmarks and into his fits on time. He strains hard to stay attached to blocks and uses his big body to wall off pursuit angles on climbs and pulls. His upright playing style leads to easy access into his frame that will leave him out-leveraged late in the rep (when the runner alters his path) against stout, slippery defensive linemen, but he fights hard to stay attached and often can get a piece of the defender rather than losing clean.</p><p>In pass protection, Adams is fluid and quick out of his stance to get rushers squared up. He excels on tighter shades and on play action when he can capitalize on his big frame, length and strength.</p><p>Adams sorts out line games and stunts quickly, anchoring on command against penetrators and the bull rush. His feet tend to get stuck when he has to redirect against effective counter moves, causing him to step under himself and create a short corner.</p><p>Overall, Adams has the size, quickness, play strength and enough finishing skills to be a high-end backup right away. He has solid-starter potential in a zone-based run scheme with the ability to get his team out of a game at tackle.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 7.2 (High-Level Backup/Potential Starter — 3rd Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 67</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: IOL11</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Aaron Banks</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGaDcoSMoqqaoZGdeqKwwKaqZqaWoXqlvsCfq2ZqYGeBbr%2FCqKytoZ6cerOxz6iprWWWpL9utculoKenmah6qrvL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
