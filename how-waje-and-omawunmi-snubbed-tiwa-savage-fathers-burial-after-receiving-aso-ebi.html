The Ankara fabrics, which were given out as aso ebi (uniforms), lightened up the wet day, as celebrities and dignitaries wore them to the party.</p><p>However, several female music stars were missing from the event.</p><p>The songstresses Omawunmi, Waje, and Seyi Shey were conspicuously absent from the August event.</p><p>“Tiwa was said to have sent the ‘aso ebi’ to Waje and Omawumi but they didn’t show up. Nobody is bothered about Seyi Shey because she had an altercation with Tiwa a few months ago at a Lagos hairdressing salon,” a source told kemiashefonlovehaven.</p><p>Despite the fact that Waje had also lost her father and was preparing for his burial, many of her followers were taken aback when she buried him on September 5, 2021, and was later seen at Toyin Abraham’s movie premiere later same evening!</p><p>“Of course she met Tiwa at Toyin Abraham’s. So, Waje could still squeeze time to attend a movie premiere some hours after her</p><p>“Dad’s burial? Its obvious Waje, Omawumi (who didn’t show up at Tiwa’s party at all) and Seyi Shey don’t like Tiwa. Tiwa had already served Seyi her tea.</p><p>“Omawumi and Waje? Well, they have chosen the path they want to tread in their vocation. You cannot be hating on a colleague and want to fly. Tiwa is flying and growing her brand, shut down Lagos during her dad’s burial and life goes on. We need more love in the entertainment industry,” a reliable source said.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entertainment-News-Nigeria-News-Naija-Music1-min.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/allwell-ademola-1300x910.jpg alt="allwell ademola" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async width=1000 height=700 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/allwell-ademola-1300x910.jpg alt="allwell ademola" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Nollywood actress, <a href=#>Allwell Ademola</a> has taken to social media to reveal to fans not to be deceived by those that feign a smile and look fine outside, stating a lot of people are battling depression.</p><p>According to her, the celebrity people think has the most strength might end up not being strong to handle situations, which is why it is advisable not to troll people on social media.</p><p>In a post shared, their lifestyle is always top-notch; this is because they always want to look okay on the outside even when they are totally depressed, while most of them are on social media to keep their mind off sadness and get relief from social media activities.</p><p>She wrote:</p><p>Alot of times…</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8CfqaKbkWS1sMOMsJijnV2Wu6V5zqaYsK2eorZuv82umZudlGLBqsPAZqqarpGcsm6ywK2fnqqjYq%2B2vsiao2aZlqmys3nRnpqeoaaeu6h5wKymZp2Snnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
