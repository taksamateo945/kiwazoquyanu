There has never, ever been a world where any Democrat or liberally-minded politician or caring conservative parent said, ‘We are gonna take everybody’s guns.'”</p><p>The ‘Jurassic World Dominion’ star – who has son Ellery, 20, and daughter Jaya, 17, from her former marriage to blues singer Ben Harper – explained that in light of school shootings, Democratic politics have simply “created a narrative” that has fed into American culture and allowed mass shootings to take place.</p><p>She told The Guardian newspaper: “So they created a story. The narrative is: ‘They’re gonna take our guns!’ and it’s been feeding American culture all these years. And now we have weekly mass shootings.”</p><p>The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School Texas was carried out by 18-year-old Salvador Ramos and – although he was reportedly not found to have any documented mental health issues – Laura explained that a boy like him should not have been able to purchase ammunition so easily.</p><p>She said: “No boy with mental health history – no human being – should ever be able to go into a store and legally buy an AR-15 and 300 rounds of ammunition. You can have a hunting rifle and you can have guns to protect your family or whatever, but there are still profound ways we can effect change so that semiautomatic and automatic weapons and no background checks are not a part of our country!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqSeqpmYrq950pyfqKecqHqivsSnq2arkZuybsHNraClZZequ264wLCqZpmimnqktMCnnp6cXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
