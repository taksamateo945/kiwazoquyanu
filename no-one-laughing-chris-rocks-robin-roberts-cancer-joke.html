You’ll show Good Morning America. We got the wife on! … We’ll show you, Robin Roberts! Matt Lauer is going to get sick next — watch!” &nbsp;Almost everyone, including Lauer, instantly became uncomfortable by Rock’s comment and it was clear that he had taken things a little too far. &nbsp;Since the incident, Internet&nbsp;users everywhere have been commenting on Rock’s poor taste in jokes. &nbsp;Watch the video below and comment your opinion on Chris Rock’s Robin Roberts cancer joke.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv4Uh9Srpqw</a></p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGilqGWfo7JuuMCunqGhnpx6pLTRoqpmqp%2BYuLR50aiZoqZdp7yjsdGtqmabkaOwpr6Mo6aknV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
