According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>legal documents</a> obtained by TMZ, The Real Housewives of Atlanta star was the one who filed for divorce, listing April 30 as the official date of the split. According to Zolciak's divorce filing, her marriage to Biermann is "irretrievably broken with no hope of reconciliation," but insiders say there's more to the story. Read on to find out the real reason the Don't Be Tardy stars&nbsp;are getting divorced.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The Real Reason Jamie Foxx Hasn't Been Discharged From the Hospital, Sources Say</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/shutterstock_101203843.jpg><p>On their&nbsp;Housewives spin-off series&nbsp;Don't Be Tardy, which aired for eight seasons before its <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>2021 cancellation</a>, the couple seemed to be going strong. But a friend of Zolciak's told People that Zolciak&nbsp;has been planning to divorce Biermann for "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>a long time</a>."</p><p>"She had not told anyone, not even family," the friend said. "She didn't tell anyone, even [her] friends were kept in the dark."</p><p>As for why Zolciak decided to finally file for divorce, the source said it comes down to the couple's finances. TMZ first reported that Zolciak and Biermann owe $1.1 million to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties from 2013, 2017, and 2018. They also allegedly owe the state of Georgia $15,000 in unpaid taxes from 2018.</p><p>"The money has been a huge issue," the friend told People. "The million-dollar tax [payment] was just way too much pressure on them."</p><p>Representatives for Zolciak told&nbsp;Best Life&nbsp;that they have no statement on the reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-11.07.30-AM.png><p>Red flags about the reality TV couple's financial situation were raised earlier this year, when their home in Alpharetta, Georgia, reportedly entered foreclosure. Per a notice shared by Fulton County in February, the property was to be put up for auction after Zolciak and Biermann defaulted on a $1.65 million loan they took out on the home, People&nbsp;reported.</p><p>Zolciak publicly denied the claims that the home was in foreclosure, per Page Six, and while the couple ended up <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>keeping the mansion</a>, other stressors continued to plague their marriage.</p><p>"There's no cheating on either side. The money has a lot to do with the split, but there were other factors," the source told People. "[Biermann's] been managing [the family] for a long time, so he technically did have a job. They're not on good terms right now."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-at-11.14.07-AM.png><p>The unnamed friend also told&nbsp;People&nbsp;that the separation has been challenging for the couple's children.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"They are a very tight-knit family and this isn't easy for any of the children," the source said in reference to Zolciak and Biermann's four kids. Zolciak also has two older daughters, whom Biermann legally adopted in 2013.</p><p>According to TMZ, Zolciak is requesting primary physical custody of their children and joint legal custody. She is also requesting spousal support and to legally restore her maiden name. (Officially, her name is currently Kim Zolciak-Biermann.)</p><p>In light of the ongoing drama, former&nbsp;Real Housewives of New York City&nbsp;star <strong>Bethenny Frankel</strong> spoke out, telling the couple they need to "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>pay their bills</a>" and the IRS.</p><p>"They've always been people who seem like they're spending more than they have," Frankel said in a May 8 TikTok video, alleging that Biermann is "on a football salary" and Zolciak is "on a Housewives salary," yet they're still overspending and "writing checks you can't cash."</p><p>"The thing is, you can't spend more than you make," Frankel said, slamming the couple for boasting about their lifestyle and making it seem "like they're perfect."</p><p>The reality star added that Zolciak and Biermann shouldn't expect people to respect their privacy at this point, as they've already shared details about their lives with the public.</p><p>"You invited us in when it was going good, and it looked like a fairy tale—or made us believe it was—well, guess what? We're coming out with you, too," Frankel said.</p><p>At the end of the video, Frankel reiterated that the couple needs to pay their bills, noting that she hates "all show and no go" and "fronting and stunting."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmq52RoXqzscCspqdlm566bsbOpZqimZtiuLO72GaZop2ioq6vuoygnK2smaO0brDIr6arm5WZeq%2Bx1qxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
