However, he is widely known, across South Africa, as a sensational actor.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Quick Profile of Ronnie Nyakale</strong></h2><ul><li><b>Name</b><span>: Ronnie Nyakale</span></li><li><b>Date of birth</b><span>: Unknown</span></li><li><b>Place of birth</b><span>: Soweto, South Africa</span></li><li><b>Nationality</b><span>: South African</span></li><li><b>Occupation</b><span>: Actor, MC, and entrepreneur</span></li><li><b>Relationship status</b><span>: Married</span></li><li><b>Wife</b><span>: Lebogang Mashilo</span></li><li><b>Children</b><span>: One (daughter)</span></li></ul><h2><strong>Ronnie Nyakale Is Best Known For His Acting Career</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Cosmo.jpg><p><span>Although Ronnie is an MC and entrepreneur, he is best known for being an actor. Ronnie Nyakale has been a lead actor in several movies and television series. </span><span>He is rumored to be in his forties, but his day and year of birth are unknown; hence, this rumor is unconfirmed. </span><span>As early as 1999, Ronnie had already started his acting career. He played the role of Shadow in the short movie Portrait of a Young Man Drowning.</span></p><p><span>In 2008, he graced our televisions screens with is an amazing act in the movie Gangster’s Paradise: Jerusalema, where he acted as Zakes Mbolole. </span><span>In 2011, he played a lead role in the movie Machine Gun, where he acted as AJ.

Although the only thing he is known for is his acting career, he also works as an EmCee and entrepreneur. </span><span>The name and nature of his business are unknown – so also the </span>number of businesses he has. Similarly, nothing is known about his properties and where they are located. Hence, calculating his exact net worth is almost impossible.</p><p>He is not big on social media as the only confirmed social media platform on which Ronnie is active is Twitter. There, he seems to be very interested in politics and lending his voice to the fight against corruption. His last tweet on the app is dated August 14, 2020. <span>Ronnie joined the ‘Bird App’ in August 2018, and he has a moderate following of over 1000 people. </span><span>In August 2020, he was on a massive following spree and promised to follow more than 1000 fans who will post a comment. However</span><span>, his fans did not seem interested in this desire to follow them as the post got only one comment.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If I'm not following you , drop your handle I'm willing to follow the first 1000+ to comment</p><p>— Ronnie Nyakale (@RonnieNyakale) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">August 14, 2020</a></p><h2><strong>Ronnie Nyakale is Married to Lebogang Mashilo</strong></h2><p><span>Ronnie Nyakale is a married man. He is married to Lebogang Mashilo, a South African woman who, like her husband, likes to keep her business to herself. Nothing is known about the exact year Ronnie Nyakale, and Lebogang Mashilo got married. </span><span>He prefers keeping his real-life private, and as such, nothing is known about what his wife does for a living and who she is in general.</span></p><p><span>Due to the couple’s choice to keep a low-key life, Lebogang Mashilo doesn’t have any known active Instagram or Twitter handle at the time of this post.&nbsp;</span><span>Nothing is known about where Ronnie Nyakale, his wife, and children live. Ronnie Nyakale is indeed a different kind of celebrity.&nbsp;</span><span>It is usually celebrities’ culture to always keep their fans updated on what is currently happening in their relationship, but Lebogang Mashilo and her husband have proven to be different.</span></p><p><span>This couple has kept everything about their relationship and marriage life away from the media. </span><span>Considering that there has been no news of family crisis or divorce threats, we can try to believe that Ronnie and Lebogang are managing their home just fine until proven otherwise.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/ronnie-nyakale.jpg alt="Ronnie Nyakale" width=700 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There is a mix-up in the media with some tabloids and online gossip sites erroneously taking Lebogang Mashile to be his wife, Lebogang Mashilo, because of an obvious similarity in their names. However, while their name may look similar, the former is a US-born South African actress and an award-winning writer and poet.</p><h3><strong>The Couple is Blessed With A Daughter</strong></h3><p><span>Considering how much Ronnie Nyakale keeps his real-life private, we should, at least, be grateful that he and his wife let their fans know that they have a child. </span><span>The couple is blessed with a beautiful daughter, whose name they have kept away from the media. </span><span>It should also not surprise you to know that their child’s age, date of birth, and place of birth are also unknown.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Maybe There Is A Reason Why Ronnie Nyakale Keeps His Real-Life Private</strong></h2><p><span>Just like us, you may be wondering why Ronnie Nyakale and his wife, Lebogang Mashilo, have decided to keep their real lives private. </span><span>Ronnie Nyakale has said nothing concerning why he decided to be discreet about his private life. </span><span>But there are various reasons why a popular television personality like him may decide to keep his life away from the public.</span></p><p><span>It may be that he is not just interested in public life, or he is only trying to keep himself and his family safe. </span><span>Whatever his reason is, his fans and the general public have no option but to respect his decision.</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaKGeqLalsYyrpqemmZp6r8XApJilnV2nsqK4jKWgn51drLa1tIywoJ%2BdXaGyo7vGmqWgZZ2WwKm1y6hm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
