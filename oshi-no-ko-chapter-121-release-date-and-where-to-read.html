At the beginning of the chapter, Ruby is struggling with the difficulties posed by her too-busy schedule. She is so dedicated to doing a great job in her role that she stays up late every night memorizing her lines. But Producer Kaburagi tells Miyako that Ruby needs serious acting lessons, so her best efforts go to waste.</p><p>Ruby, who is less experienced than her co-stars, goes to Kana Arima for advice because she wants to be able to elicit real feelings in her acting. Because of her history as Sarina, Ruby finds this suggestion extremely difficult to implement. Moreover, she struggles with ambivalent feelings toward Marina Tendouji, her mother.</p><p>Read More- Leveling With The Gods Chapter 81 Release Date and Where To Read</p><h2 id=h-past-relationship><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4637 adtester-container adtester-container-637" data-ez-name=sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4-0 ezaw=250 ezah=250 class=ezoic-ad></span></span>Past relationship</h2><p>Ruby has a vision of Sarina, who tells her that her mother never loved her, while she continues to investigate her own psyche. This information further complicates Ruby’s emotions, and she begins to doubt her value and purpose in life. Ruby must face these inner tensions and find a method to reconcile her past and current identities in order to create a credible portrayal in her next acting sessions.</p><p>Ruby’s inner turmoil over her desire to become a better actress is the focus of Chapter 120. The show focuses on the difficulties she has as Ruby/Sarina, such as her hectic schedule, the pressure to catch up to her more seasoned co-stars, and her continuous identity struggle. Ruby’s future acting classes and the complications of her past and present relationships are left hanging on a heartbreaking note at the chapter’s finale.</p><p>Read More- Keep it a secret from your mother!
