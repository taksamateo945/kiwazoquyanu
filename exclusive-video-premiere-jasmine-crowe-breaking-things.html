But with Jasmine Crowe’s latest single “Breaking Things”, both are extremely lovable.</p><p>Jasmine Crowe is a singer, songwriter, and composer from Hilo, Hawaii who knows exactly what makes a great song after winning the UK Songwriting Contest for two consecutive years.&nbsp;Since she began collaborating with Josh Anderson back in 2014, they’ve manged to impress juries, critics, and audiences.</p><p>Teaming up with Josh, she ended up winning the 2016 UK Songwriting Contest with “Lightning In A Bottle”, taking the runner-up trophy at the 2015 International Songwriting Competition with “Phoenix Rising”, and was the finalist in the 20th Annual USA Songwriting Competition with “Supernova” .&nbsp;Those are just a few examples of just how lyrically talented Jasmine is. Listening to “Breaking Things”,&nbsp; the track is another written masterpiece in our eyes.</p><p>Throughout the video for “Breaking Things”, the camera follows Jasmine as she walks around the desert barefoot, which eventually leads up to her crying in her hotel room. With mascara smudged around her eyes from all the tears, Jasmine tries to get over a man that broke her heart, even though she can’t stop thinking about him.</p><p>With lyrics like, “Don’t go breaking things / Put us back together / You shattered it forever,” and “Do you remember / We were like an accident waiting to happen,” you can tell that she’s finally realizing her relationship was meant to end from the beginning, whether she knew it before or not. By the end of the video, Jasmine stares into the camera’s lens, expressing power. She’s done with him. It’s over. She’s free.</p><p>If you love artists like&nbsp;Janis Joplin, No Doubt, Sia, Mariah Carey, Ariana Grande, Adele, Lady Gaga, Alanis Morissette, and/or Jewel, you may love Jasmine Crowe!</p><p><strong>Check out the exclusive premiere of “Breaking Things” below:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Like what you heard?&nbsp;Let us know your thoughts on our&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href=#>Facebook</a>!</strong></p><p><strong>Connect with Jasmine Crowe:</strong></p><p><a href=#>www.JasmineCroweMusic.com</a></p><p><a href=#>www.Facebook.com/JasmineCroweMusic</a></p><p><a href=#>www.Twitter.com/JasmineCrowePop</a></p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/jasminecrowemusic/</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksrmvy66qoq6VYsOqsMSoZKmqlaK2pr7EZqGaq52eu6Z5wqumsJ1dl7%2BmrcqipaBlpJ22r7PSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
