In the video, Kylie, 26, had very thick eyebrows, a faded pencil mustache, and just a hint of a goatee."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The video was also set to Justin’s 2009 track “Love Me.”</p><a title=@kyliejenner href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@kyliejenner</a><p id=content-paragraph-4>this makes me so happy</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><a title="♬ Love Me - Justin Bieber" href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ Love Me – Justin Bieber</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Kylie and her sister <strong>Kendall Jenner </strong>are very close with Justin, 29, and his wife <strong>Hailey Bieber,</strong> 27. The Rhode founder even commented on Kylie’s post and wrote, “I’m screaming!” Tons of fans let the reality star know that they thought the video was hilarious. “Wait stop Justin Bieber should totally go [dark] brunette,” one person wrote. “I live for this Kylie,” another fan commented.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Back in January, both sisters rang in the new year with Justin and Hailey in Aspen. The two of them were also spotted wearing matching leather jackets as JB made an appearance at Coachella in April 2022. In July of that year, Hailey also posted a video, speaking about some of Kylie’s products (as well as her own), while showing off her daily skincare routine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kylie-jenner-justin-bieber-tiktok-filter-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kylie and Hailey even did a matching Halloween costume together in 2022. The two of them went for a Wicked&nbsp;costume with green makeup so that they could both be Elphaba from the musical (or The Wicked Witch of the West from&nbsp;The Wizard of Oz). Their “spooky” costumes were part of Hailey’s “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Who’s in My Bathroom</a>” video series on YouTube.&nbsp; “I’m very excited to introduce my next guest to you all. In life, there are b***hes, there are snitches, but there’s nothing as good as witches. Please welcome Kylie Jenner,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnm665qrGMo5ynppWnerOx1aKqoqyjYrOztcSnm6ygmaV6uLXToWSjp6KZxq951qimnatdnrtuusSwZK2hm6m8rHnVopuep18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
