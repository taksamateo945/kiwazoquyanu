The supermodel wife of the Super Bowl XLIX MVP opened up to <a href=#>Vogue UK</a> in its March 2015 issue about the origins of her steamy, high-profile marriage.</p><p>“I knew Tom was the one straightaway,” the world’s highest-paid supermodel told the mag. “I could see it in his eyes that he was a man with integrity who believes in the same things I do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Brady, 37, and Bundchen, 34, were set up on a blind date by a mutual pal back in 2006. “This friend told me he knew a girl version of me,” Brady recalled to Details in July 2009. Gisele, meanwhile, added from the background: “And he said to me he’d found a boy version of me.”</p><p>(At the time, the NFL hunk had just split from another star, <strong><a href=#>Bridget Moynahan</a></strong>, with whom he shares a son, <strong>Jack</strong>, now 7. Bundchen, meanwhile, was single after a rocky 5-year relationship with <strong><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a></strong>.)</p><p>The two clearly hit it off, got married three years later, and now share two children together, <strong>Benjamin</strong>, 5, and <strong>Vivian</strong>, 2, along with her stepson Jack. In addition to their coveted family life, Bundchen and Brady are among the richest couples in the world.</p><p>“I’m very nurturing,” Bundchen reflected to Vogue UK about focusing on family before fortune. “I come from a large family and my parents were loving.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The world-famous supermodel also shared the golden rule in her parenting playbook. “The most important thing for me as a mum is to keep my word,” she revealed to the mag. “When I say no, I mean no. I always say they have all the time in the world to sit there saying, ‘I want it, I want it,’ but they are smart, and if I give in to them they know they can get away with it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Bundchen further explained how she manages her many different roles. “I’m a model as a job,” she told Vogue UK. “I’m Gisele, the daughter of Valdir and Vania, I’m a woman, I am a model. When I go home and shut the door, that’s it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>An advocate of all-natural lifestyles, the Brazilian-born beauty also revealed when she’s at her best. “My earliest memory was going to my grandma’s house, milking the cows and collecting the eggs from the chickens,” Gisele recalled. “If I could choose, I’d be bare feet, with animals all around me and living in a tree house. Like Tarzan and Jane, that’s my dream. I’m at my happiest around nature.”</p><p>Happier than ever on Sunday, Feb. 1, Gisele <a href=#>celebrated her husband’s fourth Super Bowl victory</a> — Deflategate controversy be damned — at the University of Phoenix stadium. “We are so proud of you daddy!!! Congratulations!!!!” Bundchen wrote on Instagram, alongside a sweet snap of her leaning up to kiss Brady. “#gopats #superbowl #sb49.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6iq5Whsm6u1KebnKCVo3qsusSwZK2nnWKvs63DsmSwmaNiwamxjKilnmWjqb%2Bitcahq5qvka56c3yQbmlr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
