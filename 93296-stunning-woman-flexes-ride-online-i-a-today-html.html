I went with R100 to Pep store Pavilion to deposit on a school uniform lay-by for my 5-year-old daughter she's been nagging me to bring her school uniform, I tried explaining to her that I don't have enough money yet I'm going to pay some money to the shop then when I have money again I'll come back with her uniform.""To my surprise, I was told someone has paid for the items I was so shocked never knew I could ever have a staying moment. Thank you so much to the customer who paid for school uniforms at Pep Pavilion because I was told the customer always come in January to pay for uniform lay-bye. My daughter is so happy she can't wait to start school. #ImStaying," she wrote.<p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
